## What is matrixmul?

I'm creating a portable C matrix multiplication library as a precursor for a portable neural network library that can fit on microcontrollers for embedded devices, hence portable. That means that I will adhere to standard C as much as possible, neglecting to use system calls that wouldn't facilitate portability across the myriad of microcontrollers. I'll also endeavor to be careful about my underlying assumptions.
